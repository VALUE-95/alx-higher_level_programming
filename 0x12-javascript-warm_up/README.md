# JavaScript Warm-up Project

## Overview
This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of JavaScript programming, focusing on scripting and foundational concepts necessary for web development. By completing this project, you will gain familiarity with variables, data types, control flow structures, functions, and more. The project aims to provide a solid understanding of JavaScript and prepare you for more advanced tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain why JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language.
- Run JavaScript scripts in a development environment.
- Understand the differences between variables and constants, and when to use each.
- Utilize various data types available in JavaScript effectively.
- Implement control flow structures like if, if...else statements.
- Write and use functions to modularize code and perform specific tasks.
- Grasp the concept of scope and its implications on variable accessibility.
- Apply arithmetic operators for mathematical operations.
- Manipulate dictionaries (objects) in JavaScript.
- Import files and work with modules.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following components:
- JavaScript scripts for implementing various functionalities.
- A README.md file providing an overview of the project and its objectives.
- Code files adhering to the specified coding standards and guidelines.
- Installation instructions for setting up the development environment.
- References to additional resources for further learning.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Node.js Version: 14.x
- Code Editor: Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs.
- Coding Standards: All code must be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x) with additional rules from the AirBnB style guide.
- Execution Environment: Scripts will be interpreted using Node.js.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Node.js 14:
   ```
   $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
   $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

2. Install semistandard:
   ```
   $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
   ```

3. Clone this repository:
   ```
   $ git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   $ cd javascript-warmup-project
   ```

5. Begin working on the project by creating and editing JavaScript files as needed.

## Usage
1. Ensure all JavaScript files have the appropriate shebang line at the beginning:
   ```
   #!/usr/bin/node
   ```

2. Make sure all files are executable:
   ```
   $ chmod +x <filename.js>
   ```

3. Execute JavaScript scripts:
   ```
   $ ./<filename.js>
   ```
