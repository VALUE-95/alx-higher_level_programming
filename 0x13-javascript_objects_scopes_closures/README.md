It covers various topics including object creation, the meaning of `this`, scope importance, closures, prototypes, inheritance, and more. By completing this project, you'll gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript programming fundamentals.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What `this` means
- What `undefined` means
- Why variable type and scope are important
- What a closure is
- What a prototype is
- How to inherit an object from another

## Requirements

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Node.js version 14.x
- **Code Style:** Semistandard compliant (Rules of Standard + semicolons, AirBnB style)
- **Executable Files:** All JavaScript files must be executable
- **Documentation:** README.md file is mandatory
- **No var:** Usage of `var` keyword is not allowed

## Setup
