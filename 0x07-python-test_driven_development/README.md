# Project Title: Python - Test-driven development

## Introduction
This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python, emphasizing the importance of writing documentation and tests before actual coding. It aims to enhance your understanding of Python programming, interactive tests, and the significance of comprehensive test coverage.

## Timeline
- **Project Start:** Jan 2, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Jan 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Deadline

## Key Concepts
1. **Never forget a test:**
   - Write documentation and tests before coding.
   - Collaborate on test cases without sharing implementation details.

2. **Intranet checks for Python projects:**
   - Checks released based on deadlines to promote TDD and consideration of edge cases.

3. **Resources:**
   - Reference materials on `doctest` and `unittest` for interactive and non-interactive tests.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Understand interactive tests and their significance.
- Recognize the importance of writing tests.
- Write Docstrings for tests.
- Create documentation for modules and functions.
- Use basic option flags for tests.
- Identify and address edge cases effectively.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5
- **File Endings:** New line at the end
- **Shebang Line:** `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md:** Mandatory at the root
- **Coding Style:** Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Execution:** All files must be executable
- **File Length:** Tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Test Folder:** `tests`
- **Test File Format:** Text files (extension: .txt)
- **Execution:** `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation:** Modules and functions must have documentation (real sentences)
