# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Overview
This project delves into understanding the fundamental concept that "everything is an object" in Python. The primary focus is on exploring Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) features and gaining insights into the behavior of different types of objects. The project encourages a thoughtful approach, emphasizing the importance of comprehension before coding.

## Background Context
The project challenges participants with questions about Python's specificity, prompting them to contemplate and discuss before attempting any code. It highlights instances where variable modifications may occur unintentionally and encourages a deep understanding of the reasons behind the solutions. The project structure includes questions about Python's behavior, where answers are expected to be concise and presented in a one-line format.

## Resources
Participants are encouraged to refer to the following resources:
- [9.10. Objects and values](resource-link-1)
- [9.11. Aliasing](resource-link-2)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](resource-link-3)
- [Mutation (Only this chapter)](resource-link-4)
- [9.12. Cloning lists](resource-link-5)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](resource-link-6)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is considered awesome
- Define what an object is in the context of Python
- Differentiate between a class and an object or instance
- Understand the distinction between immutable and mutable objects
- Define and recognize references, assignments, and aliases
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
- Display variable identifiers (memory addresses in CPython)
- Identify mutable and immutable types in Python
- Comprehend how Python passes variables to functions
