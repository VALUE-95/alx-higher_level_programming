# Python Inheritance Project

## Overview

This project focuses on Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically on the topic of inheritance. The goal is to reinforce your understanding of inheritance concepts in Python and demonstrate your ability to implement them through practical coding exercises.

## Learning Objectives

### General

1. **Why Python programming is awesome**
   - Python's readability, versatility, and extensive libraries make it a powerful programming language.

2. **What is a superclass, base class, or parent class**
   - A superclass, base class, or parent class is a class that is extended or inherited by other classes.

3. **What is a subclass**
   - A subclass is a class that inherits from another class.

4. **How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance**
   - Demonstrate ways to retrieve class attributes and methods using Python's introspection capabilities.

5. **When can an instance have new attributes**
   - Clarify under what circumstances you can add new attributes to an instance.

6. **How to inherit class from another**
   - Provide examples of inheriting a class and utilizing the `class` keyword.

7. **How to define a class with multiple base classes**
   - Show how to create a class that inherits from more than one base class.

8. **What is the default class every class inherits from**
   - Explain the default base class in Python.

9. **How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class**
   - Demonstrate the process of overriding methods or attributes in a subclass.

10. **Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses**
    - Explain the concept of inherited attributes and methods in subclasses.

11. **What is the purpose of inheritance**
    - Discuss the advantages of code reusability, extensibility, and abstraction.

12. **What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions**
    - Provide examples of using these built-in functions to check types, inheritance, and access parent class methods.

## Project Implementation

1. **Python Scripts**
   - Write Python scripts adhering to the specified requirements.
   - Ensure all scripts are well-documented.

2. **README.md file**
   - Create a comprehensive README.md file providing an overview of the project, usage instructions, and any other relevant information.

3. **Coding Style (pycodestyle)**
   - Enforce adherence to the specified coding style using pycodestyle.

4. **Executable Files**
   - Make sure all Python files are executable.

5. **Test Cases**
   - Develop test cases to validate the functionality of your code.
   - Organize test files inside a 'tests' folder.

6. **Documentation**
   - Provide meaningful documentation for modules, classes, and functions.
   - Avoid using 'import' or 'from' inside comments.

### Tips

- Collaborate with your peers on test cases to cover various scenarios.
- Use the doctest module for testing, as specified in the project requirements.
- Pay attention to the details in the documentation requirements, ensuring each sentence explains the purpose clearly.

Remember to start early, test thoroughly, and maintain good code organization and documentation practices throughout the project.
