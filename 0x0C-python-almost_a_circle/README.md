#Python - Almost a Circle

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Higher level curriculum, focusing on Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is designed to prepare you for the AirBnB project, covering various aspects of Python, including import, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getters/setters, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unittest, and file read/write operations. Additionally, you will learn about args and kwargs, serialization/deserialization, JSON, and more.
