## Understanding the Project Requirements - 0x11-Python - Network #1

This project focuses on using Python libraries (`urllib` and `requests`) to fetch and manipulate data from web resources. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Learning Objectives:**

* Utilize `urllib` for fetching internet resources and decoding responses.
* Leverage the `requests` library for simplified HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
* Fetch JSON data and handle responses.
* Work with data obtained from external services.

**Requirements:**

* **Text Editors:** vi, vim, or emacs
* **Python Version:** 3.8.5
* **Project Structure:**
    * `README.md` files at project root and folder root.
    * Executable Python scripts with proper formatting and linting.
* **Code Guidelines:**
    * Docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
    * Use `get` for safe dictionary value access.
    * Prevent code execution on import using `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

**Tips:**

* Focus on understanding how `urllib` and `requests` work.
* Explore tutorials and documentation for both libraries.
* Practice making different types of HTTP requests and handling responses.

**Additional Notes:**

* Weight (1) suggests a small project.
* Automatic review will assess your progress.


I hope this clarifies the project requirements. Feel free to ask if you have specific questions about the libraries or how to approach the tasks!
