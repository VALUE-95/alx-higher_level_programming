# Project Title: 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Overview

This project is centered around mastering Input/Output operations in Python, emphasizing file manipulation, cursor control, and JSON serialization/deserialization. The objective is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Python's file handling capabilities and effective JSON data interchange.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants are expected to:

- Articulate the strengths of Python programming.
- Demonstrate proficiency in opening, writing to, and reading from files.
- Implement file reading operations line by line.
- Manage cursor position within files.
- Adhere to best practices for ensuring proper file closure.
- Leverage the 'with' statement for efficient and safe file handling.
- Grasp the concepts of JSON, serialization, and deserialization.
- Successfully convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.
