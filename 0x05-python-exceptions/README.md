# Python Exceptions Project

## Overview

This project explores the concepts of errors and exceptions in Python programming. It covers the basics of handling exceptions, understanding the difference between errors and exceptions, and using Python's built-in mechanisms for graceful error handling.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
- Learn what exceptions are and how to use them.
- Identify scenarios where exceptions are needed.
- Demonstrate correct exception handling.
- Explore the purpose of catching exceptions.
- Raise built-in exceptions programmatically.
- Implement clean-up actions after an exception.

## Project Structure

- `task1_why_python_awesome.md`: Explanation of why Python programming is considered awesome.
- `task2_errors_vs_exceptions.md`: Discussion on the difference between errors and exceptions.
- `task3_exceptions_and_usage.py`: Code examples demonstrating the use of exceptions.
- `task4_when_to_use_exceptions.md`: Explanation of scenarios where exceptions are appropriate.
- `task5_correct_exception_handling.py`: Code illustrating correct exception handling.
- `task6_purpose_of_catching_exceptions.md`: Discussion on the purpose of catching exceptions.
- `task7_raise_builtin_exception.py`: Examples of raising built-in exceptions.
- `task8_cleanup_after_exception.py`: Code showcasing clean-up actions after an exception.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
