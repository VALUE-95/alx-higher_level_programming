## Understanding the Second Chance Project Requirements - 0x10. Python - Network #0

This project focuses on building a strong foundation in web technologies by understanding HTTP and related concepts. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Learning Objectives:**

* Explain core web concepts without external help.
* Understand URLs, HTTP requests and responses, headers, message body, methods, status codes, and cookies.
* Learn how to make requests with cURL.
* Simulate what happens when you type "google.com" in your browser.

**Requirements:**

* **Text Editors:** vi, vim, or emacs
* **Project Structure:**
    *  A `README.md` file at the project root explaining the project.
    *  Bash and Python scripts following specific guidelines.
* **Bash Script Guidelines:**
    *  Three lines long (excluding blank lines).
    *  Executable with a new line at the end.
    *  Start with `#!/bin/bash`.
    *  Second line: comment explaining the script's purpose.
    *  Use `curl -s` for silent mode. 
* **Python Script Guidelines:**
    *  Start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
    *  Compatible with Python 3.8.5.
    *  Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
    *  Document modules, classes, and functions using docstrings.

**Tips:**

* Focus on understanding the concepts mentioned in the learning objectives.
* Break down complex topics into smaller, manageable pieces.
* Use online resources like tutorials and documentations to learn about HTTP and related technologies.
* Test your code and scripts thoroughly.

**Additional Notes:**

* The weight (1) suggests this is a relatively small project.
* Automatic review will assess your progress.


I hope this clarifies the project requirements. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions about specific concepts or how to approach the tasks!
