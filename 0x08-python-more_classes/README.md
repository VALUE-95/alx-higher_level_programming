# Project Title: 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description

This project, authored by Guillaume, is part of the Python programming curriculum focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The goal is to deepen understanding of classes, objects, attributes, and various concepts related to OOP in Python.

## Project Details

- **Weight:** 1
- **Project Start:** Jan 4, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Jan 5, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Checker Released:** Jan 4, 2024 12:00 PM
- **Auto Review Deadline:** At the project deadline

## Resources

Before diving into the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Object Oriented Programming](#) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](#) (Specific paragraphs mentioned in the prompt)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](#)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](#)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](#) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](#)
